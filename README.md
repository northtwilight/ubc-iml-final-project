# Final project for the University of British Columbia's [_Introduction to Machine Learning course_](https://intro-machine-learning.netlify.app/), Apr-Jun 2024
---
## Introduction and explanatory comments
This Jupyter notebook comprises my work on the final project for the UBC data science course, _Introduction to Machine Learning_ (IML).

The IML course is one of two required courses beyond the prerequisite course, _Programming in Python for Data Science_, taken in Jan 2024. 

I have one remaining course left to take in order to obtain a [_Key Capabilities in Data Science_ certificate](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs-credentials/key-capabilities-data-science-certificate) from the University.

## The project
from the Final Project instructions:

For this project, students will be using a dataset regarding the different types of Canadian cheeses.

The original data was found on the Government of Canada's Open Government Portal but has unfortunately been taken down.

We have done a bit of wrangling and cleaning for you already and have provided you with a modified version of the dataset.

The data is stored in `cheese_data.csv` which is located in a data folder of the `final_project` directory. The data were obtain from Kaggle and follows an Open Government Licence (Canada).
